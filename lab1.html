<h2>Introduction</h2> 
<div class ="box b">
<p>Hello, my name is Marcel and I'm a senior studying Interactive Media at Lewis University.
    I usually work as a Brand Ambassador which means I promote a multitude of different brands at concerts, live events, malls, and even on the streets. I have promoted brands like Samsung, Coca-Cola, Geico, Niantic, Salesforce, Toyota, dodge, and jeep just to name a few. The responsibilities are educating the consumer about the product, engaging with them, and sometimes asking them to take survey in exchange for some free merchandise. I also work liqour tastings and promotional events at bars for almost every liqour brand you could think of.</p>
    
<p> Initially when I started undergrad at the University of Iowa I was interested in Computer Science as I had taken a Microsoft Visual Basic course in high school. However, math is not my strong suit and all the prerequisites really put me off. I instead I decided to study Journalism and also pursue a certificate in entrepreneurship. I still would have had one more year at Iowa to finish, but Covid cut my stay there short. However, the major reason why I picked Lewis University to transfer to is that they offered the Interactive media major. It's the perfect hybrid between journalism, communication, and technology/design depending on the track you take. That being said there's a lot of different areas I could apply my degree. Ultimately, I chose the technology course because I feel like at least having an understanding of web/application programming puts me ahead of a lot of other job applicants even if the position is not specifically for web/mobile app development. I'm also going to be one of the first students to graduate under Interactive media as it is a relatively new major.</p>

<h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
<div class ="box b">
<p>
 Video games have always been a huge part of my life since I was around the age of 5. I started off with the Playstation 2 and have vivid memories playing the game Starwars Bounty Hunter with my Dad. Eventually I got into pokemon for the nintendo game boy advanced and eventually the nintendo DS when it was released. Once I was in middleschool I got more into online gaming on console and later in highschool on PC. Some of my favorite games currently are World of Warcraft, Five M modded Grand Theft Auto 5 servers, Valorant, and Ghost of Tsushima.
